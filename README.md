## Public Service Announcer

PSA can multiplex annoucements, important or otherwise.

It's a single binary that works as a CLI for sending messages from a
console, and can provide announcements as a service via e.g. a webhook.

## Usage

```shell
Usage of ./psa:
  -dryrun
    	validate and log but don't send anything
  -message string
    	the message to announce
  -v	verbose logging
```

## Configuration

For information on how to prepare your Discord server or Slack
workspace for receiving announcements, see the [Discord webhooks intro]
or [Slack webhooks API guide].

All configuration is optional, but without any there will be nowhere to
announce messages.

```shell
export PSA_DISCORD_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../..."
export PSA_SLACK_WEBHOOK="https://hooks.slack.com/services/.../.../..."
```

If you want to customize the way announcements are presented, you can
set `PSA_MSG_TEMPLATE` in your environment:

```shell
export PSA_MSG_TEMPLATE="ðŸ“£ {{.Message}}"
```

`.Message` is (currently) the only field available to the template. If
your template does not use it, `psa` will not send anything.
